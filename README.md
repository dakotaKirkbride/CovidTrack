### Dashboard View
The Dashboard View displays high-level data for the World, United States, and a selected state. Clicking into these views shows a more detailed dashboard view, displaying a graph view of new cases within the last 30 days, mortality rates, and data trends. Note that for the state view, the user can select any state from the dropdown before viewing the dashboard.

### Screening Tool (In Progress)
The screening tool allows the user to input relvant health information (age, preconditions, symptoms) and based in the information provided, advises the user on next steps. These steps could include remaining socially distant, going to the hospital, or reading up on relevant info regarding Covid-19.

### Information View
The information view shows high-level information regarding Covid-19, along with relvant links to reputable sources, like the WHO and CDC.
